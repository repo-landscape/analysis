# acdh-dashboard-notebooks

Python notebooks for retrieving and analysing data in the context of the **Repository Landscape** project.  This involved gahering and analysis of information from various sources. Most prominently [ACDH-CH redmine](https://redmine.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/), and on the other end the central catalogue of research products in the Eurpean Research Area,  [OpenAIRE](https://explore.openaire.eu/), but also a number of other related systems.
